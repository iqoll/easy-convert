## Units of measurement converter
A JavaScript-based web application that provides a simple and intuitive interface for converting units of measurement in different categories, such as length, weight, and temperature. In this project i tried to use my knowledge to use event listeners to detect user input and dynamically updates the output fields with the converted values, based on pre-defined conversion functions. Additionally, the application features a tab-based interface with color-coded tabs that allow users to switch between different conversion categories, as well as a background color that changes depending on the selected tab. The application code is organized into modular functions that can be easily adapted or extended to support additional conversion types or user interface features.
