### Units of measurement converter

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A JavaScript-based web application that provides a simple and intuitive interface for converting units of measurement in different categories, such as length, weight, and temperature. In this project i tried to use my knowledge to use event listeners, Javascript DOM, Functions and Conditional. The big takeaway: 

* Uses event listeners to detect user input and dynamically updates the output fields with the converted values, based on pre-defined conversion functions
* Features a tab-based interface with color-coded tabs that are switch depending on the selected tab
* Code is organized into modular functions that can be easily adapted or extended to support additional conversion types or user interface features.
* The code includes functions to convert between different units of length, mass, and temperature

I used all of these concepts for the first time in this project, and was able to successfully implement them in the first four day sprint.
